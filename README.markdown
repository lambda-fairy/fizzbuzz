FizzBuzz variations
===================

FizzBuzz is a simple programming problem.  The algorithm is as follows:

> For numbers 1 through 100,
>
> * If the number is divisible by 3, output Fizz;
> * If the number is divisible by 5, output Buzz;
> * If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (15), output FizzBuzz;
> * Otherwise, output the number.

This repository is a collection of FizzBuzz implementations.
